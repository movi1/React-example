    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Something fascinating about me is I don't know how much i should say about myself, 
        so i'll say that i've lived in 8 different states in 3 different countries and i can fluently speak more than one languages,
        and i love research and learning about different cultures, so if anyone is curious about that then you'll be in my good books.</p>
